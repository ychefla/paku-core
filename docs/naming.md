# Naming

- **EDGE** = the ESP32 device firmware (canonical term going forward).
- **CORE** = legacy term that may still appear in code/commits. Treat as a synonym for EDGE.

Repository mapping:
- `paku-core` → EDGE firmware (ESP32)
- `paku-iot`  → Host-side tools/services (collectors, monitors, integrations)
